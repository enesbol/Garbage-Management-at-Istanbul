# Garbage-Management-at-Istanbul

-Estimation of the amount of garbage that Istanbul will produce in 2022 with XGBRegressor.


-Clustering districts with KMeans by the features that I created myself with the data that I gathered
from open sources.


-Through these clusters, it was estimated which regions should be given priority in garbage
management.


-Which locations waste facilities or recycling facilities should be constructed in the future.


-Results and the features that I created represented on the layered dynamic maps with the web app.


-All of that project deployed to a multi page cloud based web app and used for a presentation.
